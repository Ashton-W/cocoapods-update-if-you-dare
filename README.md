# Cocoapods Update If You Dare



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cocoapods-update-if-you-dare'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cocoapods-update-if-you-dare

## Usage

Run `pod update` and the plugin will try and persuade you to use alternatives before it dares you to just update everything anyway.
